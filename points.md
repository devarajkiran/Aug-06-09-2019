### Parallelism vs. Concurrency

* Parallelism __Your code runs in several Cores parallely__


### Performance, Responsiveness

* Performance ____

* Process
* Context Switch

## To create a Thread

* Extend __Thread__ class
* Override __run()__ method
* Call __start()__ to start the thread

* A Thread object is different from the actual thread
* A Thread instance is created on the heap
* Calling __start()__ method on the thread instance, creates the __actual thread__
* The __thread__ has its own __stack__. The __run__ method executes in that stack
